Minishell is a project aimed at building a minimalistic shell, mimicking essential features of Bash. It provides an opportunity to delve into UNIX process management, system calls, and the intricate workings of a shell.

This project is part of the curriculum at 42 Madrid and follows strict guidelines to encourage low-level programming skills, error handling, and robust software development practices.

Shells are the backbone of UNIX-like operating systems, acting as an interface between users and the system. Understanding how a shell works at a fundamental level is crucial for system programming, security, and performance optimization.

Minishell aims to provide a deep understanding of:

How processes are created and managed.

The role of file descriptors in input/output redirection.

Signal handling and built-in command execution.

Implementing pipelines and environment variable management.

Minishell functions similarly to Bash but with a limited scope. It handles user input, parses commands, executes built-in functions, and manages processes effectively. Key elements include:

Lexing & Parsing: User input is tokenized and structured into commands.

Execution: The shell handles both built-in commands and external programs.

Process & File Descriptor Management: Redirections and pipes are implemented using system calls.

Signal Handling: Properly managing signals like Ctrl+C, Ctrl+D, and Ctrl+Z.

Environment Handling: Managing $PATH, custom variables, and command execution.
